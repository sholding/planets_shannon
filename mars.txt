Cold and dry, but everything is my favourite colour
The two moons might be a problem for Wolfman
But the mummy will appreciate the lack of humidity
This is my contribution to the Mars mission
It is fun being a fancy scientist

Sometimes I wear a labcoat, just to look fancy
Tye died lab coats are the best
Sometimes I wear safety goggles, just to look fancy
